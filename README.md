# WeatherApp
I built a company which provide facilities of gym tracking, and Live weather temperature in the gym tracking user can measure Body Mass Index and Check how many calories to intake as per the workout. Alkometer app that calculates blood alcohol level based on weight, number of beerbottles drunk, time in hours and gender. Weather Application is seperate application where API is in use for current temperature, it will locate the area and tells the Minimum and Maximum temperature with sunset and sunrise

I have used Images for Gym Tracker app, and MVVM is also implemented. I have an api key used in Weather app, which can be found in code. Website I used: "https://api.openweathermap.org/
